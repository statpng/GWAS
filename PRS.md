### If not available,

#### Using summary statistics
(1) Find a published paper related to our phenotype of interest
(2) Collect SNPs associated with the phenotype over the published papers
(3) Access the GWAS catalog (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/) and search our phenotype
(4) Get SNPs with 'association count' as higher as possible.
